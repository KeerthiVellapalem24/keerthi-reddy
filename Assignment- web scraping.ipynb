      "11DEBUGGING\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know enough to write more complicated programs, you may start finding not-so-simple bugs in them. This chapter covers some tools and techniques for finding the root cause of bugs in your program to help you fix bugs faster and with less effort.\n",
      "To paraphrase an old joke among programmers, writing code accounts for 90 percent of programming. Debugging code accounts for the other 90 percent.\n",
      "Your computer will do only what you tell it to do; it won’t read your mind and do what you intended it to do. Even professional programmers create bugs all the time, so don’t feel discouraged if your program has a problem.\n",
      "Fortunately, there are a few tools and techniques to identify what exactly your code is doing and where it’s going wrong. First, you will look at logging and assertions, two features that can help you detect bugs early. In general, the earlier you catch bugs, the easier they will be to fix.\n",
      "Second, you will look at how to use the debugger. The debugger is a feature of Mu that executes a program one instruction at a time, giving you a chance to inspect the values in variables while your code runs, and track how the values change over the course of your program. This is much slower than running the program at full speed, but it is helpful to see the actual values in a program while it runs, rather than deducing what the values might be from the source code.\n",
      "Raising Exceptions\n",
      "Python raises an exception whenever it tries to execute invalid code. In Chapter 3, you read about how to handle Python’s exceptions with try and except statements so that your program can recover from exceptions that you anticipated. But you can also raise your own exceptions in your code. Raising an exception is a way of saying, “Stop running the code in this function and move the program execution to the except statement.”\n",
      "Exceptions are raised with a raise statement. In code, a raise statement consists of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The raise keyword\n",
      "A call to the Exception() function\n",
      "A string with a helpful error message passed to the Exception() function\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n",
      ">>> raise Exception('This is the error message.')\n",
      "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
      "  File \"<pyshell#191>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
      "    raise Exception('This is the error message.')\n",
      "Exception: This is the error message.\n",
      "If there are no try and except statements covering the raise statement that raised the exception, the program simply crashes and displays the exception’s error message.\n",
      "Often it’s the code that calls the function, rather than the function itself, that knows how to handle an exception. That means you will commonly see a raise statement inside a function and the try and except statements in the code calling the function. For example, open a new file editor tab, enter the following code, and save the program as boxPrint.py:\n",
      "def boxPrint(symbol, width, height):\n",
      "    if len(symbol) != 1:\n",
      "      ➊ raise Exception('Symbol must be a single character string.')\n",
      "    if width <= 2:\n",
      "      ➋ raise Exception('Width must be greater than 2.')\n",
      "    if height <= 2:\n",
      "      ➌ raise Exception('Height must be greater than 2.')\n",
      "    print(symbol * width)\n",
      "    for i in range(height - 2):\n",
      "        print(symbol + (' ' * (width - 2)) + symbol)\n",
      "    print(symbol * width)\n",
      "for sym, w, h in (('*', 4, 4), ('O', 20, 5), ('x', 1, 3), ('ZZ', 3, 3)):\n",
      "    try:\n",
      "        boxPrint(sym, w, h)\n",
      "  ➍ except Exception as err:\n",
      "      ➎ print('An exception happened: ' + str(err))\n",
      "You can view the execution of this program at https://autbor.com/boxprint. Here we’ve defined a boxPrint() function that takes a character, a width, and a height, and uses the character to make a little picture of a box with that width and height. This box shape is printed to the screen.\n",
      "Say we want the character to be a single character, and the width and height to be greater than 2. We add if statements to raise exceptions if these requirements aren’t satisfied. Later, when we call boxPrint() with various arguments, our try/except will handle invalid arguments.\n",
      "This program uses the except Exception as err form of the except statement ➍. If an Exception object is returned from boxPrint() ➊ ➋ ➌, this except statement will store it in a variable named err. We can then convert the Exception object to a string by passing it to str() to produce a user-friendly error message ➎. When you run this boxPrint.py, the output will look like this:\n",
      "****\n",
      "*  *\n",
      "*  *\n",
      "****\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "O                  O\n",
      "O                  O\n",
      "O                  O\n",
      "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n",
      "An exception happened: Width must be greater than 2.\n",
      "An exception happened: Symbol must be a single character string.\n",
      "Using the try and except statements, you can handle errors more gracefully instead of letting the entire program crash.\n",
      "Getting the Traceback as a String\n",
      "When Python encounters an error, it produces a treasure trove of error information called the traceback. The traceback includes the error message, the line number of the line that caused the error, and the sequence of the function calls that led to the error. This sequence of calls is called the call stack.\n",
      "Open a new file editor tab in Mu, enter the following program, and save it as errorExample.py:\n",
      "def spam():\n",
      "    bacon()\n",
      "def bacon():\n",
      "    raise Exception('This is the error message.')\n",
      "spam()\n",
      "When you run errorExample.py, the output will look like this:\n",
      "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
      "  File \"errorExample.py\", line 7, in <module>\n",
      "    spam()\n",
      "  File \"errorExample.py\", line 2, in spam\n",
      "    bacon()\n",
      "  File \"errorExample.py\", line 5, in bacon\n",

By “failing fast” like this, you shorten the time between the original cause of the bug and when you first notice the bug. This will reduce the amount of code you will have to check before finding the bug’s cause.\n",
      "Assertions are for programmer errors, not user errors. Assertions should only fail while the program is under development; a user should never see an assertion error in a finished program. For errors that your program can run into as a normal part of its operation (such as a file not being found or the user entering invalid data), raise an exception instead of detecting it with an assert statement. You shouldn’t use assert statements in place of raising exceptions, because users can choose to turn off assertions. If you run a Python script with python -O myscript.py instead of python myscript.py, Python will skip assert statements. Users might disable assertions when they’re developing a program and need to run it in a production setting that requires peak performance. (Though, in many cases, they’ll leave assertions enabled even then.)\n",
      "Assertions also aren’t a replacement for comprehensive testing. For instance, if the previous ages example was set to [10, 3, 2, 1, 20], then the assert ages[0] <= ages[-1] assertion wouldn’t notice that the list was unsorted, because it just happened to have a first age that was less than or equal to the last age, which is the only thing the assertion checked for.\n",

Logging is a great way to understand what’s happening in your program and in what order it’s happening. Python’s logging module makes it easy to create a record of custom messages that you write. These log messages will describe when the program execution has reached the logging function call and list any variables you have specified at that point in time. On the other hand, a missing log message indicates a part of the code was skipped and never executed.\n",

You might even accidentally remove some print() calls that were being used for nonlog messages. The nice thing about log messages is that you’re free to fill your program with as many as you like, and you can always disable them later by adding a single logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL) call.

(Although Mu should prevent the debugger from entering Python’s built-in functions.) The debugger moves on to line 2, and highlights line 2 in the file editor, as shown in Figure 11-2. This shows you where the program execution currently is.\n",

      "Stepping through the program with the debugger is helpful but can also be slow. Often you’ll want the program to run normally until it reaches a certain line of code. You can configure the debugger to do this with breakpoints.\n",
      "Breakpoints\n",
      "A breakpoint can be set on a specific line of code and forces the debugger to pause whenever the program execution reaches that line. Open a new file editor tab and enter the following program, which simulates flipping a coin 1,000 times. Save it as coinFlip.py.\n",

      "Halfway done!\n",
      "Heads came up 490 times.\n",
      "If you ran this program under the debugger, you would have to click the Step Over button thousands of times before the program terminated. If you were interested in the value of heads at the halfway point of the program’s execution, when 500 of 1,000 coin flips have been completed, you could instead just set a breakpoint on the line print('Halfway done!') ➋.

      "Figure 11-4: Setting a breakpoint causes a red dot (circled) to appear next to the line number.\n",
      "You don’t want to set a breakpoint on the if statement line, since the if statement is executed on every single iteration through the loop. When you set the breakpoint on the code in the if statement, the debugger breaks only when the execution enters the if clause.\n",
      "The line with the breakpoint will have a red dot next to it. When you run the program under the debugger, it will start in a paused state at the first line, as usual. But if you click Continue, the program will run at full speed until it reaches the line with the breakpoint set on it. You can then click Continue, Step Over, Step In, or Step Out to continue as normal.\n",
      "If you want to remove a breakpoint, click the line number again. The red dot will go away, and the debugger will not break on that line in the future.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "Assertions, exceptions, logging, and the debugger are all valuable tools to find and prevent bugs in your program. Assertions with the Python assert statement are a good way to implement “sanity checks” that give you an early warning when a necessary condition doesn’t hold true. Assertions are only for errors that the program shouldn’t try to recover from and should fail fast. Otherwise, you should raise an exception.\n",
      "An exception can be caught and handled by the try and except statements. The logging module is a good way to look into your code while it’s running and is much more convenient to use than the print() function because of its different logging levels and ability to log to a text file.\n",
      "The debugger lets you step through your program one line at a time. Alternatively, you can run your program at normal speed and have the debugger pause execution whenever it reaches a line with a breakpoint set. Using the debugger, you can see the state of any variable’s value at any point during the program’s lifetime.\n",
      "These debugging tools and techniques will help you write programs that work. Accidentally introducing bugs into your code is a fact of life, no matter how many years of coding experience you have.\n",
      "Practice Questions\n",
      "1. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variable spam is an integer less than 10.\n",
      "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",
      "3. Write an assert statement that always triggers an AssertionError.\n",
      "4. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to be able to call logging.debug()?\n",
      "5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?\n",
      "6. What are the five logging levels?\n",
      "7. What line of code can you add to disable all logging messages in your program?\n",
      "8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
      "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
      "10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?\n",
      "11. What is a breakpoint?\n",
      "12. How do you set a breakpoint on a line of code in Mu?\n",
